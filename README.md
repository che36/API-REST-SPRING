# API-REST-SPRING
In this project we will build a pokedéx (pokemon repository) through a Rest API made with Spring Webflux, Spring Boot's reactive module. By the end of the project you will have seen concepts of reactive programming, handler, mono and flux and also created a Rest Api with your data saved in MongoDB!

# :shipit: Pokedex 



:house: Para rodar esta Rest API local você precisa usar
` mvn clean ` & ` mvn install `

:arrow_forward: E rodar na sua IDE a classe main()

public class ReactivewebApplication `


:arrow_right: Endoints:

http://localhost:8080/pokemons

http://localhost:8080/pokemons/events

http://localhost:8080/pokemons/{id}

Esta RestAPI esta hospedada no Heroku, você consegue acessar em: https://mighty-journey-86009.herokuapp.com/

**Dê um fork, e crie seu pokedex reativo :D**
