# API-REST-SPRING
In this project we will build a poked√©x (pokemon repository) through a Rest API made with Spring Webflux, Spring Boot's reactive module. By the end of the project you will have seen concepts of reactive programming, handler, mono and flux and also created a Rest Api with your data saved in MongoDB!
